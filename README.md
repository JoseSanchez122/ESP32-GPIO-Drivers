# ESP32-GPIO-Drivers

This repository contains code for a room temperature controller and an occupancy counter. It uses an ESP32 to monitor temperature and activate a fan when it exceeds a set limit. It also tracks room occupancy, triggering an alarm if the maximum is reached. Custom GPIO drivers enable the control.

## Features
- GPIO Drivers Built from Scratch
- UART communication
- LCD display drivers
- Timers for timing operations
- Used of ADC Drivers
